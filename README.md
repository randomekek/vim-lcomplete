# vim-lcomplete
opinionated autocomplete for vim.
- every key pressed above 2 letters opens autocomplete
- tab: next completion
- s-tab: prev completion
- case insensitive
- fuzzy matching: skip any number of letters (key order must be retained). irev will match InsertReturnValue
- python implementation (vimscript is too difficult to learn)
